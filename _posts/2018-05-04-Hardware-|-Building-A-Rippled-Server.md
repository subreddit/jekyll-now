Choosing hardware for the production level rippled server was challenging due to the recommendations on storage and cost associated.  My goal was to procure the least expensive equipment that could run rippled at a production level requirements.  If building a node or cluster for an Enterprise the hardware would change vastly.  For the server I chose a used Dell C2100 from eBay because of the low cost for a server with twelve 3.5" drive bays.  The cost of the server was $215 and included dual Xeon E5620's, 48GB of RAM, twelve HD caddy's, one power supply (expandable to two), and shipping.  For redundant power I purchased an additional power supply from eBay for $26.27.

The 3.5" hard drives I chose were new 3TB desktop drives simply for the reason I could reuse that exact size on another server's existing array if I was unsuccessful.  The four 3TB 7200RPM SATA drives would give me 9TB and I could expand up to six additional drives (12 total bays, 2 for SSD) allowing me 27TB of storage as time progresses.  These new drives were $84 each.

CacheCade Pro v2 and FastPath are technologies from LSI I have used in the past.  The used MegaRAID 9260-4i with BBU was $39.99 from eBay and I purchased the additional CacheCade hardware key for $18.99.  Unfortunately the documentation for CacheCade compatibility is dated.  In the past I used 120GB Sandisk X110's that were on compatibility list.  Instead I purchased two new 128GB Sandisk X600 for $42.50 each.

My total cost was $721.25.
